== Description ==

Are you looking to add a personal touch to your WordPress admin panel and make it more user-friendly? If so, you're in luck! When active plugin will add a new column named "Featured Image" to the posts and pages admin panel, displaying the featured image thumbnails if available.

**Why Add Custom Columns?**

By default, the WordPress admin panel displays essential information about your posts and pages, such as title, author, categories, and more. However, if you frequently use featured images in your content, you might find it useful to see those images directly in the admin panel. This can save you time and make your content management experience more efficient.
